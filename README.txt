Project Description:

This project is a demo for a Unity3D game called Polymorph.
Polymorph was create by three CIS students at the University of Oregon as part
of the Spring 2021 course, CIS 410, Introduction to Game Programming.

The game was created using assets, both free and purchased, from the Unity Asset Store.
While the modeling was not done ourselves, the design, layout, lighting, post-processing,
and concepts for the game are our own. Additionally, all code unless otherwise noted was
written by our team, with the help of our coursework and online tutorials.


Game Overview:

You are the wizard's apprentice, and an experiment has gone a bit... wonky. Get to the wizard
tower so the wizard can turn you back into your regular self (unless you feel like being a turtle
forever I guess!). There's another problem however: The portal to the tower is currently inactive,
and the crystal mines that have the crystals to power it are closed off due to a recent explosion...
Maybe there's another way in....

Tutorial Information:

Polymorph is currently a demo, built in rougly 8 weeks by three undergraduate students.
As such, it naturally comes with its bugs, quirks, and other aspects which need attention!
It does not claim to be a complete game by any means, but we hope that what can be explored
so far is fun nonetheless!

Please note while exploring the project the following cheats which allow you to view the
full scope of what we have tried to build out so far:

- Press ESC to see the controls!

- Press F1 to reset the player's position!

- Press F2 to skip and see the mines!

- Press F3 to skip and see the wizard tower!


HINTS/WALKTHROUGH:

- The key to your house is sitting on the table with the two chairs next to it.

- Use the turtle form to get within range of the horse by dragging the log to bridge the
  gap and walking through it! You are too short as the turtle to climb the ladder or any stairs.
  
- Use the horse and turtle form to complete the seesaw puzzle near the blocked-off gate to the
  mines. This will get you the crow form, which is needed to successfully detonate the explosive crystals.
  
- Use the crow form to grab one of the orange crystals, fly up high, and drop it to blow up the mine entrance
  so you can enter the mines!
  
- Solve the mine puzzles to gather the crystals you need to re-activate the tower.

- Return to the forest level and place the crystals where they are meant to go, and enter the tower.
