Ah! Good morning!

No, I'm not talking to you in your head, genius.
Over here!
#
You sleep well?
I'm glad you're finally awake.
I was starting to get worried.
...
Not that this wasn't my intention...
I don't make mistakes.
That would be ridiculous.
...
You can understand me, right?
...
Would you just get out of bed so I know you still have a brain in there?
#
Oh thank god.
Now, I know this isn't quite what you had in mind.
But maybe it'll be fun? You're cute this way, at least.
...
Don't give me that look!
...
I can't see your face, but I can imagine it.
Listen, clearly some of it worked.
You can turn into animals now!
...
I just don't know how to turn you back yet.
YET.
...
When you get back to the tower I'll try to change you back,
But honestly, I think you're gonna like this.
Sometimes the unexpected is better!
Just go outside, and you'll see.
#
Well that's a problem!
Listen, you can't do much like this, but you're probably still just as destructive as you were as a human!
I don't know everything, including where your key is.
Just find it so we can get started okay?
