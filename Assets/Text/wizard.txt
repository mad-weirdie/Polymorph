No, I'm not talking to you in your head, genius.
Over here! The crystal. They're good for lots of things, it seems.

I was starting to get worried.
Not that this wasn't my intention...
...
I don't make mistakes.
That would be ridiculous.
You can understand me, right?
...
Would you just get out of bed so I know you still have a brain in there?
#
Oh thank god.
Now, I know this isn't quite what you had in mind.
But maybe it'll be fun? You're cute this way, at least.
...
Clearly some of it worked.You can turn into animals now!
...
I just don't know how to turn you back yet.
...
When you get back to the tower I'll try to change you back, but maybe it'll be fun.
First things first, let's get you and those little turtle feet outside.
