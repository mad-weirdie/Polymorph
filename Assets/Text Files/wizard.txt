Hello?
...
Hellooooo?
...
Ah! Good morning!
Over here.
#
That's better. You sleep well?
I'm glad you're finally awake.
I was starting to get worried.
...
Not that this wasn't my intention...
I don't make mistakes.
That would be ridiculous.
...
You can understand me, right?
...
Would you just get out of bed so I know you still have a brain in there?
#
Oh thank god.
Now, I know this isn't quite what you had in mind.
But maybe it'll be fun?
