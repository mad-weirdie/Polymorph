Well hello.
Good morning!
You sleep well?
...
I'm glad you're finally awake.
I was starting to get worried.
...
Not that this wasn't my intention...
I don't make mistakes.
That would be ridiculous.
...
Anyway.
Don't look so alarmed.
I'm not in your head or anything.
I'm talking to you through the crystal on your desk.
...
You can understand me, right?
...
Would you just get out of bed so I know you still have a brain in there?
